        This is nihilism, not license.<br>
        If you use the work that appears to be "licensed" under this without permission,
        The author probably won't sue. I strongly recommend abandoning your thoughts.

        It has no legal binding force. Therefore, it probably has no legal binding force.
        This text is a poem that mimics licensing requirements, and the act of "licensing" NC-1 is metaphysical.
        The author gives up linguistic thinking in exchange for copyright.
